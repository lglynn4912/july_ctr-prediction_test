# CTR Prediction System for Large-Scale Advertising

**Active Development** - Implementation in progress this week!

## Overview
A production-ready click-through rate (CTR) prediction system built with Transformer architecture, designed for large-scale advertising platforms. This project demonstrates practical ML engineering skills for ad prediction systems.

## Architecture
- **Model**: Transformer-based neural network with attention mechanisms for CTR prediction
- **Framework**: PyTorch with modular, production-ready components
- **Data Pipeline**: Scalable preprocessing designed for billion-query datasets
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including AUC, precision, recall, and calibration

## Features
- [x] Professional project structure and dependencies
- [x] Modular codebase with separation of concerns
- [ ] Data preprocessing pipeline (ETA: Day 1)
- [ ] Transformer model implementation (ETA: Day 2)
- [ ] Training pipeline with validation (ETA: Day 3)
- [ ] Evaluation metrics and visualization (ETA: Day 4)
- [ ] Production scaling documentation (ETA: Day 5)

## Production Scaling Approach
While this prototype uses standard libraries for demonstration, production implementation would leverage:
- **Apache Spark** for distributed feature engineering across billion-record datasets
- **Spark MLlib** for parallel model training and hyperparameter tuning
- **Delta Lake** for versioned feature stores and model artifacts
- **Triton Inference Server** for low-latency model serving

*Note: I've implemented similar distributed processing pipelines in coursework, handling multi-GB datasets with Spark DataFrames and custom transformations.*

## Dataset
Using the Criteo CTR dataset, a standard benchmark in computational advertising research, containing millions of ad impressions with categorical and numerical features.
